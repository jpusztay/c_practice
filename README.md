# c_practice

A repository to store a very simple interpreted language built primarily to further familiarize myself with the c programming language. This is not meant to be a fully featured language, but will consist of features including varibles, mathematical operations, strings, variable scope, methods, and conditional statements (by extension, boolean type).
